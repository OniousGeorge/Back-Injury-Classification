# Back-Injury-Classification
Developed classification functions and algorithms that accurately classifies 310 patients into three main classifications: normal 'DO' herniated disk 'DH' and spondilolysthesis 'SL'

The aim of this project is to develop a Python-based machine learning application that classifies back injuries into three categories using the L1 (Manhattan Distance) and L2 (Euclidean Distance) nearest neighbor algorithms. This project will demonstrate the effectiveness of distance-based classifiers in medical diagnostics and aid healthcare practitioners in determining the severity of back injuries from patient data.
